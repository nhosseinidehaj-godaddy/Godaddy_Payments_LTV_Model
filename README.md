GoDaddy Payments was launched in mid 2021 and is one of the newest products offering in GoDaddy. Since the launch, we have seen a gradual adoption of GoDaddy payments within GoDaddy US shopper base.
Given that GoDaddy Payments recent launched we have limited data to train ML models and even limited data to do out of sample testing. Also, many features offered by GoDaddy Payments are recently released such as Apple Pay/Google Pay/ Tap to Pay or are in process of getting released such as ACH and Invoice. Hence, we do not even have any data to train models.
 We have also observed that many powersellers only use GoDaddy domains while they get their website from other providers. To mitigate all these issues, we have developed a Lifetime Value model which caters to GoDaddy payments needs.
